# Grad-CAM implementation for Keras
Using mostly code from [totti0223](https://github.com/totti0223/gradcamplusplus)'s Gradcam++'s implementation.

This code is explained on [this blog article](http://blog.samuelprevost.com/neural-network/grad-cam-explaining-cnn-predictions/) and more in depth in the paper [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391).
